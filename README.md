# Skytells Framework for PHP
Version 3.0 ( Last Release Version )

Version 3.1 ( Current Development Version )

Skytells Framework is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. Skytells Framework lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.
